# 370-Final-Project
This project uses an ssh connection and was built in a VNC Viewer desktop. 
When the decibel sensor detects a rise in levels, it blinks the 8 lights. 
When the sensor is placed near music the lights "dance" with the beat.
Addtionally, we added an option to read the battery voltage.
sys.argv's
'Dance' = run the lights
'Volts' = display the battery voltage
